# Kotlin bootcamp
I think I know most of the content but it might be good to study it again to have a stronger fundation.

## Basics
- `val` cannot change but `var` can
- `toInt` to convert to `Int` (some for others)
- `?` to support null value
- `!!` wraps optional (not recommended)
- `a?.b?.c?.d?.length ?: 0`, get length if a, b, c, d are not null and return 0 if any of them is
- `$variable` and `${variable.method()}`
- `if (fish in 1..100)`, range. Also, you can add `downTo` and `step`
- `when`, like switch but maybe better?
- `Array(5) { it * 2 }`
- `for (xx in xxs)`

## Functions
- `fun` for functions
- `Unit` is like `void`
- `if (condition) value else value`, `if` has a value
