I spent very little time watching appbrewery's tutorial before started working on my first app, [AnimeOne](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeOne). 
I spent 3 days writing the core functions and then, I started writing UIs. Because of react native, it wasn't that challenging for me to get used to it. 
After that, I rewrote [AnimeGo](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeOne) with flutter. Now, [WoWs Info](https://github.com/HenryQuan/wows-info-future). 
Overall, flutter is great but it has weaknesses. However, it can be great for certain apps. That's why I am learning both native and cross platform. 
There is no perfect solutions. It is more about what works the best for your usecase.
