# Mobile App Development training
I started with `Native iOS` development back in late 2016 and later switched to `React Native` in late 2017 and now, `Flutter` is my choice of developing mobile apps. 
I was an 'apple fanboy' but later, I switched to `Android` because my `iPhone 7` had severe `battery issue`. 
I have been using Android for quite a while but I don't know a lot about Android development. 
It might be the time to study native again I guess (both iOS and Android). 
I have used `React Native` and `Flutter` for some time but I still think native is better. 
However, they do fit my need better but it doesn't mean that I can skip native. 
`There is no shortcut in life` and I think it applies to mobile app development. 
Now, I am learning more about native development.
## Technology involved
- Swift, Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, Dart, JavaScript and TypeScript
- SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose, React, Node and JSX
- Maybe more?

# Contents
## [Native Android](https://github.com/HenryQuan/mobile_app_development_training/blob/master/Android/README.md)
Mainly focused on learning `Kotlin` and Android development. I had some experience with Android development but I don't think it is sufficient to make a good app yet. 
## Native iOS
Mainly focused on learning `Swift`, `UIKit`, `SwiftUI` and more. I had more experience with iOS development and `WoWs Info` was originally written in `Swift 2` and I have a better understanding of how iOS works. 
## React Native
I have used `React Native` in a few apps with both `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`. It has many issues and that's why I am moving to `Flutter`. 
## Flutter
Flutter is now my choice of mobile app development but it is not only mobile. 
You can use it for developing mac and web. If you want to, you can wrap web with electron to work on Windows, Linux and UWP. It is for all platforms but it is not perfect and the main issue is with the native side. However, it depends on your need. 
## Extra
Other frameworks/technology that I tried or heard of before. 
### Xamarin
Xamarin is pretty good in my humble opinions and it is closer to native. You can share your C# code across iOS and Android. The only issue is how to bind native libraries. I think it shouldn't be that hard but I still don't know. `Xamarin Form` is also great to share UI across all devices.
### Ionic and other web-based
They are not native so I don't consider them. (Flutter is a bit different I guess.)
### NativeScript
This is another interesting one. I never used it before but it says it can use all native API so it is more native than React Native but I wonder if that's the case.
### Hardcore C++
Before everything above was a thing, I think bigger companies either have two teams working on iOS and Android or they can do `hardcore C++`. The idea is similar to Xamarin I guess. You still write native UI but C++ libraries are shared between two platforms to cross platform. However, I never tried it before so I don't know how to do it.

# What's the best choice?
It depends on your need. `Flutter` is the best for me because I don't use native features that much.
- If you are a small team or just a solo like me, `React Native` and `Flutter` are great choices because they are low cost and you get two apps or more with one codebase
- For larger companies, native is the way to go because it is `the native`. Xamarin can also be a good choice if you want to share some code and UI. Hardcore C++ might be the traditional way to share code and it might be great as well 
- Alternatively, you can mix native with `React Native` or `Flutter` so you get the best of both.
