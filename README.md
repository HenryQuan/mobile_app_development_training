# Kotlin Android training
I have switched to Android for quite a while but I don't really know a lot about Android development. It is time to study native again I guess. I have used React Native and Flutter for some time but I still think native is better. They do fit my need better but it doesn't mean that you can skip native. There is no shortcut and now, I am learning more native development.
