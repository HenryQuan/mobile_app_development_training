# IOS Bootcamp
I am skipping some early sections because I already know most of them and there is no point of writing down any notes.

## Section 4: Collections, Constants & Variables
- `randomElement()` on array to replace `int.random(range())`
- `...` is a `range operator`, you can also `..<` and more

## Section 6: Auto Layout and Responsive UIs
This is quite important and I think it is similar to android's `constraint layout`. For react native or flutter, it is a bit different like how they layout UIs.
